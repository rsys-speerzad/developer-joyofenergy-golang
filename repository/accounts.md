# accounts.go Explanation

The `accounts.go` file defines a repository for managing the relationship between smart meter IDs and price plan IDs. This repository provides a way to retrieve the price plan associated with a given smart meter ID. Below is a detailed explanation of its components:

---

## `Accounts` Struct
```go
type Accounts struct {
    smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts map[string]string
}
```
The `Accounts` struct contains a single field:
- **`smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts`**: A map where the keys are smart meter IDs (`string`) and the values are price plan IDs (`string`). This map represents the relationship between smart meters and their associated price plans.

---

## Constructor: `NewAccounts`
```go
func NewAccounts(smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts map[string]string) Accounts {
    return Accounts{
        smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts: smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts,
    }
}
```
This function initializes and returns a new `Accounts` instance:
1. **Input**: Takes a `map[string]string` that defines the relationship between smart meter IDs and price plan IDs.
2. **Output**: Returns an `Accounts` struct with the provided map.

---

## Method: `PricePlanIdForSmartMeterId`
```go
func (a *Accounts) PricePlanIdForSmartMeterId(smartMeterId string) string {
    // TODO indicate missing value
    return a.smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts[smartMeterId]
}
```
This method retrieves the price plan ID associated with a given smart meter ID:
1. **Input**: Takes a `smartMeterId` of type `string`.
2. **Operation**: Looks up the `smartMeterId` in the `smartMeterToPricePlanAccounts` map.
3. **Output**: Returns the associated price plan ID as a `string`. If the `smartMeterId` is not found, it returns an empty string (default behavior of Go maps for missing keys).
4. **TODO**: The comment indicates that the method should be updated to handle cases where the `smartMeterId` is not found (e.g., by returning an error or a default value).

---

## Key Points
- **Simple Data Access**: This file provides a straightforward way to map smart meter IDs to price plan IDs.
- **Dependency Injection**: The `NewAccounts` constructor allows the map to be injected, making it easy to use different data sources (e.g., mock data for testing).
- **TODO for Missing Values**: The `PricePlanIdForSmartMeterId` method currently does not handle missing keys explicitly. This could lead to unexpected behavior if a `smartMeterId` is not found in the map.
